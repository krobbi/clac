# About
Clac is a command-line calculator that is being created as a personal project
to replace the default Windows calculator and address some minor annoyances
with it:
* Relatively long time to start up.
* No support for custom functions and variables.
* No way to evaluate an expression from a command-line session.

Clac is not fully implemented and currently behaves as a 'cat' program.

# Goals
* [x] Read arithmetic expressions in a loop.
* [ ] Read optional command-line arguments as expressions.
* [ ] Parse tokens from expressions.
* [ ] Parse expression trees from tokens.
* [ ] Evaluate expression trees.
* [ ] Add a context for defining and using variables.
* [ ] Add support for defining and using functions to the context.
* [ ] Add a library of built-in functions and variables (square root, pi, etc.)
